# Silvaco
 In this project, we evaluated the paper which is, Maizan Muhamad, Sunaily Lokman, Hanim Hussin, “Optimization Fabricating 90nm NMOS Transistors Using Silvaco”, IEEE conference, 2009.
	
* The materials used in CMOS are Silicon, Sio2, Polysilicon, Aluminum, Electrodes.
* used Silvaco for simulation. codes had two libraries ATHENA and ATLAS.
* Drain Current(A) Vs Gate Bias(V)  and also Drain Current(A) Vs  Drain Voltage(V) drawn under the terms of the article.

we approximately achieve the result of the paper. \
