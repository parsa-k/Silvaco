# Silvaco
 In this project, we evaluated the paper which is, Maizan Muhamad, Sunaily Lokman, Hanim Hussin, “Optimization Fabricating 90nm NMOS Transistors Using Silvaco”, IEEE conference, 2009.
\\
\begin{itemize}	
\item The materials used in CMOS are Silicon, Sio2, Polysilicon, Aluminum, Electrodes.
\item used Silvaco for simulation. codes had two libraries ATHENA and ATLAS.
\item Drain Current(A) Vs Gate Bias(V)  and also Drain Current(A) Vs  Drain Voltage(V) drawn under the terms of the article.
\end{itemize} 
we approximately achieve the result of the paper.
